						<p>This recipe book app was made within the timespan of 6th of June 2022 â€“ 20th of September 2022 during weekdays as a learning project - so probably in less than 70 days if one takes away vacation and sick leave due to Covid-19, which both amount to a total of two weeks.</p>
						<br></br>
						<p>The motivation behind the whole project was the lousy usability of recipes around internet. Most recipes are featured inside a blog or an article which users cannot access easily, or there is a considerable amount of cognitive stress they have to expose themselves to before they can actually start the cooking process. I personally have a hard time navigating up and down most recipes with my phone or with a tablet when there are a lot of paragraphs, unrelated text and/or ads.</p>
						<br></br>
						<p>I did not have a mentor or a senior to guide me through and everything was made with trial-and-error, reading a fair amount of documentation and tutorials. As such, the code and the app is a product of its time - my first year of coding - and may include anti-patterns, smells of refactoring and spaghetti code.</p>
						<br></br>
						<p>The aim of this project was to understand more about React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, accessibility, end-to-end testing and anything / everything between. As such, I deem it succesful and I enjoyed learning a bunch of new stuff.</p>
						<br></br>
						<p className="pb-2">Feats which were planned but not implemented due to time constraints:</p>
						<ul className="list-disc">
							<li>Do a put update instead of post + delete when editing a recipe. I know, I know.. it was a backend thing and I did not have time to learn C# and .NET as much as I would have liked to have</li>
							<li>In general, the backend could have been better and more robust</li> 
							<li>Dashboard, which features statistics, widgets which show recipe suggestions from somewhere, recipe articles</li>
							<li>Calendar, which allows user to drag and drop recipes in to it</li>
							<li>Component, which allows user to copypaste an url which the component then scrapes of information (ingredients, steps) for recipe adding purposes</li>
							<li>One to five star review of every recipe</li>
							<li>Doubling and tripling of ingredients on the fly - one portion, two portions, etc.</li> 
							<li>A preference of a store or stores per ingredient - not all stores stock all ingredients always</li>
							<li>A simple dividing element to the ingredient list if the recipe features multiple parts which are not made in unison </li>
							<li>Ability to register, log in and have multiple family members under one profile, each with their own settings and reviews</li>
							<li>More accessibility testing, testing with real people</li>
							<li>Code could have been tighter overall, more error checking and logging</li>
							<li>Sharing of recipes</li>
							<li>Make the whole app a Progressive Web App</li>
							<li>Ability to log in how long it took to make a recipe, and then make the average of different times the default time</li>
							<li>A better component library of reusable components</li>
							<li>This text in Finnish</li>
							<li>Etc., probably forgot something from this list :)</li>
						</ul>
